"This project began as a hands-on practice with React, focusing on integrating APIs to enhance my understanding of frontend development. As the project evolved, it took shape as a dynamic inventory management and display tool, tailored for local shops. Built entirely with React, the interface is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, allowing shop owners to effortlessly add, update, and manage their inventory. The application could transform into a digital menu card, displaying available products to customers without the need for manual input or additional manpower. With Reactâ€™s state management and reusable components, the app ensures a smooth, interactive experience for both shop owners and their customers, making it a valuable tool for streamlining daily operations in small businesses."
